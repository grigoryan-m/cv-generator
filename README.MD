# Free CV generator!

Written in pure javascript.

Used libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Nothing yet</li>
</ul>

No design for index page, bad design for CV itself. That's not a serious project, i'm just practising my frontend skills.

All the data is transfered through GET parameters.

Still working with path to files, cause it just won't work fine until you edit it for yourself. On the other side, when i will use github pages, it'll work fine.
